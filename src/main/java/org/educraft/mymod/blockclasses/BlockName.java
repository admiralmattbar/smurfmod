/*
 * This is the class for the new block added by this mod, the Block Name. A new block in the game will need its own class just like an item. It is
 * important for you to add the block to your registry as shown in the Registry class and then reference it here (below you call the Registry values
 * in setUnlocalizedName and setRegistryName). You can set other values like the material (here made out of cake) and the things shown at the bottom.
